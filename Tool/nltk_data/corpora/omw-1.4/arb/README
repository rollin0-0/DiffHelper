2015: This improved version is an extension of the original Arabic
Wordnet (http://globalwordnet.org/arabic-wordnet/awn-browser/), it was
enriched by new verbs, nouns including the broken plurals that is a
specific form for Arabic words (please see reference paper in
citation.bib).



This conversion loses any synsets not in Princeton WordNet 3.0

This conversion uses the following mappings

There are a few AWN IDs that couldn't be mapped (new synsets)

I read in the roots and broken plurals, although we won't show them by default.

I couldn't get prettyprint to work with lxml; but it does with xmlstarlet
mv arb2-lmf.xml arb2-lmf-ugly.xml; xmlstarlet  format --indent-spaces 2 --encode utf-8  arb2-lmf-ugly.xml > arb2-lmf.xml



there is also an out of date version without diacritics, produced by Motaz SAAD:
wn-data-ara.tab
